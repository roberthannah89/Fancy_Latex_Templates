% Document-specific commands:  Packages I wouldn't add to every single document.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% These are commands you wouldn't use in every article, just this article. I've added some packages here that you might want to check out, but haven't included them by default (just commented them).

% Add your content here!

%comment: Comment out sections of code:
\usepackage{comment}

%add line numbers to text
%\usepackage[left]{lineno}
%activate line numbering (line numbers are not shown by default)
%\linenumbers

%Fancy tooltips: hover over references to display references theorem, equation, etc. (in Adobe Acrobat only!)
%See http://user.mendelu.cz/marik/fancy-preview/
%Usage on command line: fancy-preview FILE_NAME --fancy_options="preview,tooltipmark"

\section{Section}\label{sec:First-section}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lem}[First lemma]\label{lem:First-lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a lemma.

\end{lem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let's also add an align:

%
\begin{align}\label{eq:First-equation}
f(x) = x^2+x-1
\end{align}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}[First theorem]\label{thm:First-theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a theorem.

\end{thm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us demonstrate cleveref's cleverness. Short-form clever reference: \cref{lem:First-lemma}. Long form clever reference: \Cref{lem:First-lemma}. Now for theorem: \cref{thm:First-theorem} and \Cref{thm:First-theorem}. Let's try equations: \cref{eq:First-equation} and \Cref{eq:First-equation}. Now sections: \cref{sec:First-section} and \Cref{sec:First-section}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{cor}[First corollary]\label{cor:First-corollary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a corollary.
