%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Importance of Avoiding Communication}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Costs:} FLOPs, Communication (memmory heirarchy, network)
\item FLOPs used to be more expensive, now communication cost is (time \&
energy).
\item Conventional analysis only cares about FLOPs or convergence rate (decrease
per iteratate) irrespective of real costs.
\item Need to consider scaling of FLOPs and communication to create practical
algorithms.
\item Potential for massive speedups.
\item Algorithms in libraries do asymptotically more communication than
necessary.
\end{itemize}
