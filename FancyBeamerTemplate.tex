% ~~~ Robert Hannah's Fancy Beamer Template ~~~ %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Take a look at the article template first. 
% Some differences:
% 1) amsthm, hyperref, color are already loaded. So adding options is problematic and can lead to clashes.
% 2) We have made amthm compatible by getting rid of the example environment
% 3) We have eliminated the options in geometry for compatiblity
